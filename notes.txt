This is a Node.js app n listening at port 3001 n when we hit via browser it will throw us a message.
Pre-req: Node, Redis - runs the node application inside the loacl 

Task: It's to run the app inside the docker container.

Our container must have redis n our application server up n running, so here we will have the
multiple containers communicating with each other via docker-compose.yml .

As we know container is an instance of the image, so before having the conatiner we need to have 
our customisable image with us.

Image consists of config, dependency fs snapshot and we will generate the image with the dockerfile.
If our application server was independent of redis server n suppose it was performing simple addition 
then there was no need of docker-compose.yml file.

Only after redis came into the scene we needed to run the redis server inside the another container
and both containers must be up and running in order to make comm b/w them - docker-compose.yml
